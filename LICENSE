Remarklet, the Remarkable Markup Bookmarklet (http://remarklet.com/)
by Zachary Kendall Watkins, zwatkins7@yahoo.com

This JavaScript bookmarklet is built on jQuery and jQuery UI and will allow you to rapidly prototype web site changes and more easily communicate web site revisions with others. More enhancements are planned for the future (such as copying page elements and allowing file saving via data URI), but I wanted to make this first version available to the public as soon as I felt it was ready with the basic, essential features.

If you enjoy using this tool, I would 
appreciate hearing from you!
